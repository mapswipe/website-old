        <p>Download the app and swipe through satellite imagery while tapping the features you spot. The tiles you mark
          will then be drawn by other volunteers to create detailed maps.</p>
        <p>Contribute from anywhere and track your progress with badges. Commit to help a little every day during your morning commute or while stuck in queue for your coffee. <strong>In as little as 10 minutes, you can help to
            locate entire communities.</strong></p>
