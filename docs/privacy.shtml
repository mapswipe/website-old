        <h3>How and when we collect information about you</h3>

        <h4>When you directly give us information</h4>
        <p>When you download the MapSwipe app, you will have to create an account and provide us with some information 
          about you so that we can link your contributions to your account. We are hoping to introduce an option to map 
          as a guest without you having to give us any information, however this is not yet available.</p>

        <h4>When you indirectly give us information</h4>
        <p>We monitor how the app is used, for example the pages you view and how you navigate the app, to help us
          improve the experience. This data is aggregated and anonymised, so we are not able to identify individual
          users. If you use our website, we may also obtain information about your visit to our website by using
          cookies. Please visit our <a href="cookies.html">cookie policy</a> for information on this.</p>

        <h3>What information we might collect</h3>
        <p>When you create an account, we will ask you to provide your email address and create a username and password
          for your account. Your email address is referred to in this Privacy Notice as 'personal information', whereas
          your username will be publicly visible and tied to your contributions in the app. Your password is encrypted
          and not visible to anyone.</p>

        <h3>If you're under 16</h3>
        <p>If you're aged under 16, you must get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide any personal
          information to us.</p>

        <h3>How and why we use your information</h3>
        <p>Your personal information is only used for the purpose of logging into your account or resetting your
          password. We do not use it for any other purpose including marketing or contacting you in any way.</p>

        <h3>Who do we share your information with?</h3>
        <p>We will only use your information for the purposes for which it was obtained. We will not, under any
          circumstances, sell or share your personal information with any third party for their own purposes, and you
          will not receive marketing from any other companies, charities or other organisations as a result of giving
          your details to us.</p>

        <h3>How we protect your information</h3>
        <p>We use technical and corporate organisational safeguards to ensure that your personal information is secure.
          We limit access to information on a need-to-know basis and take appropriate measures to ensure that our people
          are aware that such information is only used in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>

        <p>We undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we hold to ensure that your information is
          only accessible by appropriately trained staff and volunteers.</p>

        <p>However, please be aware that there are always inherent risks in sending information by public networks or
          using public computers and we cannot 100% guarantee the security of data (including personal information)
          disclosed or transmitted over public networks.</p>

        <h3>How long will we keep your information?</h3>
        <p>We will keep your personal information for as long as you use the MapSwipe app. After two years of inactivity
          on your account (i.e. you have not logged in or opened the app), we will delete your account and all personal
          information. Your contributions will remain in our database but will no longer be linked to your public
          username or personal information.</p>

        <h3>International transfers of information</h3>
        <p>Our servers are located in the US, which means that your personal information is transferred, processed and
          stored outside the EEA. You should be aware that, in general, legal protection for personal information in
          countries outside the EEA may not be equivalent to the level of protection provided in the EEA.</p>

        <p>However, we take steps to put in place suitable safeguards to protect your personal information when
          processed by the supplier such as entering into the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses.
          By submitting your personal information to us you agree to this transfer, storing or processing at a location
          outside the EEA.</p>

        <h3>Your rights to your personal information</h3>
        <p>Data protection legislation gives you the right to erase the personal information about you which is
          collected through MapSwipe and processed by the British Red Cross.</p>

        <p>This can be done within the app by selecting the option to 'Delete my account' at the bottom of your account
          profile page. This will remove all of your personal data from our servers and unlink your map contributions
          from your public username, which will also be deleted.</p>

        <h3>How to make a complaint or raise a concern</h3>
        <p>If you would like more information, or have any questions about this policy, to make a formal complaint about
          our approach to data protection or raise privacy concerns please contact the Information Governance Team:</p>
